# Interactive Random Color Picker by Mouse Hovering

This app allows you to randomly pick a color from any of the tiles shown on the screen. To select the color that you've found, just click on the tile and viola! That's it!

**Note** that the output of the color that you've just copied to the clipboard will be in RGB format.
